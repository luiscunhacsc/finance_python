    "\n",
    "This result is expected and demonstrates the trade-off when using a protective put: you reduce the downside risk but incur an additional cost in the form of the option premium. This cost is the price of the \"insurance\" against larger potential losses, and it's a strategic decision in risk management to protect against significant declines in the value of an asset.\n"
