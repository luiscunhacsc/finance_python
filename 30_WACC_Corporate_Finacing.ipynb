    "To find the optimal capital structure, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is calculated for different debt ratios, ranging from 0% to 100%. The objective is to identify the debt ratio that minimizes the WACC, hence optimizing the company's capital structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **equity ratio** is the complement of the debt ratio (1 - debt ratio).\n",
    "- The **cost of equity** increases as the debt ratio increases due to the rising financial risk.\n",
    "- The **optimal debt ratio** is the one that results in the lowest WACC, which indicates the most cost-effective mix of debt and equity financing for the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the model calculated the **optimal debt ratio** to be **90%**, corresponding to a **minimum WACC of 0.0006**. This suggests that, under the given assumptions, the company should finance its operations primarily with debt to achieve the lowest cost of capital. However, this result should be interpreted with caution, as extremely high debt levels could increase bankruptcy risk.\n"
