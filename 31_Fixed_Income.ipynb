    "The calculated values for **Modified Duration** and **Convexity** provide insights into the sensitivity of the bond's price to changes in interest rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modified Duration**: \n",
    "   - The modified duration value of **4.9320** indicates that for every 1% change in interest rates, the price of the bond is expected to change by approximately 4.9320% in the opposite direction. \n",
    "   - A higher duration means the bond is more sensitive to interest rate changes, and thus, it carries more interest rate risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convexity**:\n",
    "   - The convexity value of **35.6023** shows the degree to which the duration of the bond changes as interest rates change.\n",
    "   - Positive convexity implies that as interest rates decrease, the bond price increases at an increasing rate, and as interest rates increase, the bond price decreases at a decreasing rate.\n",
    "   - Convexity is an important measure to assess the bond’s price volatility beyond what is captured by duration alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics are crucial for fixed-income investors to evaluate the risk and potential price volatility of bonds in response to interest rate fluctuations.\n"

    "2. **Interest Coverage Ratio**:\n",
    "   - The Interest Coverage Ratio is **24.35**, which means that the company earns 24.35 times its interest obligations from its operating earnings (EBIT).\n",
    "   - A high interest coverage ratio indicates that the company is easily able to meet its interest payments, which is a positive sign for bondholders concerned with the issuer's ability to meet its debt obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Current Ratio**:\n",
    "   - The Current Ratio is **1.36**, indicating that the company has $1.36 in current assets for every $1 of current liabilities.\n",
    "   - A Current Ratio above 1 suggests that the company has a good level of liquidity, meaning it can cover its short-term obligations with its short-term assets. This is a healthy liquidity position, reducing the risk for bondholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "These ratios provide a snapshot of the company’s financial stability and ability to meet its debt obligations, which are crucial factors for assessing the risk associated with the bond.\n"
